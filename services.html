      <h1>Services</h1>
      <p>All of our services are available free of charge to members and any interested
      JHU-affiliated groups. If you are a Hopkins student who is not an ACM member, but are
      interested in using one or more of the services described below, feel free to contact us
      anyway.</p>
      <h1 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h1>
      <p>Our services are student run, and as a result we cannot guarantee 100% reliability for any
      of the systems discussed below. That being said, we do our best, and we’ve done our best to
      engineer the systems with a certain amount of redundancy wherever possible.</p>
      <p>(If you are a user of our systems and would like to help us make things <em>more</em>
      reliable, we are always looking for more volunteers to help maintain them).</p>
      <p>Also, please note that it is your responsiblity to abide by JHU computer usage policies
      when using our systems.</p>
      <h1 id="services">Services</h1>
      <h2 id="email">Email</h2>
      <h3 id="your-acm-email-address">Your ACM Email Address</h3>
      <p>We offer all of our members username@acm.jhu.edu email addresses. When we create your
      account, we’ll set up forwarding from this address to an email of your choice, but if you
      want to send email from this account you can do that from mail.acm.jhu.edu or by configuring
      your email client to point at imap.acm.jhu.edu:143 and smtp.acm.jhu.edu:587.</p>
      <h3 id="mailing-lists">Mailing Lists</h3>
      <p>We also offer mailing lists to all Hopkins groups (and members, as needed). We use
      mailman, one of the most common pieces of traditional list management software, as an
      alternative to the JHU IT provided mailing lists.</p>
      <h2 id="storage-and-hosting">Storage and Hosting</h2>
      <h3 id="file-storage">File Storage</h3>
      <p>All of our members are provided 20 GB of backed up storage and 1 TB of “scratch” space
      (that we don’t make any promises to keep backed up) in our OpenAFS cell. AFS is a distributed
      filesystem, meaning that if you install an OpenAFS client on your own computer, you will be
      able to access your files from anywhere in the world– not just our own systems.</p>
      <p>Student groups are given 40 GB of storage space, as well as a 1 TB scratch volume.</p>
      <p>AFS has a robust permissions and group architecture; members may create their own groups
      and control access to their files.</p>
      <h3 id="web-hosting">Web Hosting</h3>
      <p>As part of the provided storage, we allow members and groups web hosting. If you put files
      in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/afs/acm.jhu.edu/user/name/acmsys/public_html</code> (or
      just <code class="highlighter-rouge">/afs/acm.jhu.edu/group/name/public_html/</code> for a
      group), they will show up on the internet at <code class=
      "highlighter-rouge">https://www.acm.jhu.edu/~name/</code>.</p>
      <p>If you want to run more complicated web services (like CGI scripts), talk to us and we can
      make that happen too.</p>
      <h2 id="desktops-and-shell-servers">Desktops and Shell Servers</h2>
      <p>We run a number of Linux workstations in the office for our members to use. (Your home
      directories on these machines is the 20 GB AFS volume mentioned above). We tend to be very
      flexible when it comes to installing new software on those machines, so if they are missing
      some software that you really need, just ask!</p>
      <p>At least one of them (at the moment, this is eridani) also dual-boots Windows 7 as
      well.</p>
      <p>Members can also SSH remotely into the desktops and shell servers; The recommended machine
      to SSH remotely into is currently <code class="highlighter-rouge">acm.jhu.edu</code>.</p>
      <h2 id="mirroring">Mirroring</h2>
      <p>We provide mirrors of a number of open-source projects. For example, we mirror the package
      repositories of a number of major Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, and
      Fedora.</p>
      <h2 id="compute-and-virtualization">Compute and Virtualization</h2>
      <h3 id="openstack">Openstack</h3>
      <p>Members (upon request) and groups can log into our Openstack instance and create virtual
      machines! Thanks to a lot of donated hardware, we’re running a number of compute nodes in our
      server room that Openstack will allow you to schedule virtual machines on. By default, you
      are limited to ten VMs running in the cluster, but if you really want more, just ask.</p>
      <p>All members are given a single public IP address (reachable from the outside world) that
      they can point at a virtual machine.</p>
      <h3 id="sandstorm">Sandstorm</h3>
      <p>We also run a Sandstorm instance that our members can log into. Sandstorm is a “one-click
      installer for web applications”, and provides many packaged web apps that users can install,
      run, and then share with others. So if there’s some web application that you really want to
      use, Sandstorm provides a great (and secure) way to set it up without having to delve into
      the somewhat more complicated world of setting up your own virtual machine.</p>
      <p>As an example, take a look at this game of BrowserQuest, running on our Sandstorm
      instance.</p>
      <h2 id="cloud-hosted-services">Cloud-Hosted Services</h2>
      <p>We run a number of other services in our local ACM “cloud”, such as the following.</p>
      <h3 id="gitlab">Gitlab</h3>
      <p>We run a Gitlab instance for our members. We host git repositories there for all the
      various code and projects the ACM has worked on, and also allow members to create both public
      and private repositories for their own projects.</p>
      <p>We also run Gitlab CI (very similar to Travis CI, if you’re familiar with that) that will
      let you schedule builds and run tests for your projects.</p>
      <h3 id="jupyter">Jupyter</h3>
      <p>You may also know Jupyter as “iPython”. Jupyter is a web application designed for
      scientific computing that lets users run code and make plots in their web browser using a
      variety of languages designed for scientific computing and data processing (such as Python,
      R, Octave, and so on).</p>
      <p>The ACM runs a Jupyter instance for its members.</p>
      <h3 id="wiki">Wiki</h3>
      <p>We run a MediaWiki instance that all members are allowed to edit, if you’d like to
      contribute documentation, quotes, miscellaneous facts about the ACM, or random other
      information.</p>
      <h3 id="quassel-and-irc">Quassel and IRC</h3>
      <p>We have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> channel,
      #jhuacm, on the freenode.net network. There’s a link to connect in the sidebar, but you can
      also point your IRC client at irc://chat.freenode.net and join the channel #jhuacm.</p>
      <p>To allow members to persist their IRC connections when idling, we run a <a href=
      "https://quassel-irc.org/">Quassel</a> instance. Quassel is a distributed IRC client; there
      is a “core” (running inside our cluster) keeps your connection to the remote IRC server alive
      that the various graphical clients connect to. In addition to the desktop IRC client, there’s
      also a mobile client (for both iOS and Android) and a web application.</p>
      <p>At the moment, quassel accounts are available on request; they do not currently get
      auto-created.</p>
      <h2 id="gaming">Gaming</h2>
      <p>We also (as the choice of BrowserQuest as an example for Sandstorm might suggest) tend to
      like to play video games in our “free time”.</p>
      <p>The ACM runs both a Minecraft and Minetest server in the cluster; if you’re interested in
      this, or in us running other game servers, feel free to ask on #jhuacm IRC or drop by the
      office and ask someone in person.</p>
      <h1 id="full-documentation">Full Documentation</h1>
      <p>Full documentation on these services is available on our wiki (linked on the sidebar).</p>
      <p>If you have any questions not answered by this page or the documentation, please send us
      an email at admins AT acm.jhu.edu, hop on IRC (#jhuacm on chat.freenode.net as mentioned
      above), or come bother us in person.</p>
