# JHU ACM Website

Port of old website from [Wayback Machine Snapshot from 2017-10-04][1] by
Bailey Parker on 2018-02-11.

The core pages of the site were preserved, but some parts (such as the museum)
were inconsistently archived and thus were omitted. Some links and information
were updated (including removing links to services not currently running).
Pages accessible when spidering from the home page (excluding broken ones, as
discussed above) were kept and tidied using [html5-tidy][2]. CSS was tidied
using [Prettier][3].
